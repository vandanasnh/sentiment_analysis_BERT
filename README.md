**Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis**

This repository provides a framework for fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis tasks. 

**Data Description**

The included dataset consists of 3000 customer reviews categorized into two sentiment classes:

* **Label 1:** Positive Review
* **Label 0:** Negative Review

For training and evaluation purposes, the dataset is split into:

* **Training Set:** 2400 samples (80%)
* **Testing Set:** 600 samples (20%)

**Requirements**

* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch (`torch`)
* Transformers (`transformers`)
* NumPy (`numpy`)
* Pandas (`pandas`) (optional, for data exploration)
* Matplotlib (`matplotlib`) (optional, for visualization)

**Installation**

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers numpy pandas matplotlib (optional)
   ```

**Usage**

1. **Download or Prepare Data:**

   * Replace the placeholder `your_data_directory` with the path to your sentiment analysis dataset that follows the provided format (text and labels).
   * Alternatively, you can use your own dataset structure and modify the data loading logic accordingly.

2. **Fine-Tune BERT:**

   ```bash
   python train.py \
       --data_dir your_data_directory \
       --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \  # Adjust for your chosen BERT model
       --output_dir output \  # Adjust for your desired output directory
       --epochs 3  # Adjust the number of training epochs
       --batch_size 16  # Adjust the batch size as needed
   ```

   This command will initiate the training process, storing model checkpoints and evaluation results in the `output` directory.

3. **Evaluation:**

   The script automatically evaluates the fine-tuned model on the testing set. You can find the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) in the `output` directory. 

**Additional Notes**

* This is a basic example. You may want to experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs) for optimal performance.
* Consider incorporating techniques like data augmentation, attention visualization, and sentiment lexicon integration to further enhance the model.
* Explore pre-trained models from the `transformers` library (e.g., `distilbert-base-uncased`) that might be more efficient for sentiment analysis tasks.

This code is provided for educational purposes only. The specific hyperparameters and steps might need adjustments depending on your dataset and desired performance level.
